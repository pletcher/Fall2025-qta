# Quantitative Textual Analysis â€“ Fall 2025 â€“ Course Schedule

As a friendly reminder, you should never use generative AI (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, vel sim.)
to write your lab report for you, even if the lab requires you to use a language model in your
analysis.

These lab reports are spaces for you to think. Out-sourcing your thoughts to a language model
deprives you of that opportunity and prevents you from learning the material.

Using generative AI to write your lab report will be considered a serious violation of the Tufts
University Honor Code.
