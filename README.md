## Description

Despite the recent proliferation in digital sources for a variety of literary
fields and subfields, quantitative textual analysis has often been viewed as
anathema to pursuits in the humanities. Rather than set computational and
literary methods at odds, this course seeks to reconcile them through careful
application of statistical methodologies alongside literary modes of inquiry.
Far from a positivistic approach to literary texts, this course will guide
students towards enriching their understanding of the texts that they study
by taking a “distant reading” approach (cf. Moretti 2000) that complements,
rather than supplants, close reading and critical analysis.

This course introduces humanists to the tools and methodologies of
quantitative textual analysis through corpus linguistics. Using the R
programming language, students will learn how to build and evaluate corpora
related to their areas of expertise, and they will gain experience with basic
statistics and probability theory, hypothesis testing and experiment design,
and methods in sociolinguists, stylistics, and diachronic textual analysis.
Students will gain substantial practical experience through weekly labs and
homework assignments, culminating in a final presentation and paper aimed at
publication.

NB: Although programming is a major part of this course, the focus is on
corpus linguistics and statistical methods, not on programming per se.

## Learning objectives

This course will prepare students to:

1. Build textual corpora from a variety of sources
2. Analyze textual corpora using statistical methods and the R programming language
3. Test and evaluate hypotheses based on these analyses
4. Apply these techniques to works within their fields of expertise
5. Work with embeddings and language models to answer specific research questions

## Required Textbook

## Grading

- 1/6 Attendance and participation
- 1/6 Reading quizzes
- 1/3 Labs
- 1/3 Final project

This class will use the following grading scale, after applying the above weights:

- ≥ 90%: A
- 80–89%: B
- 70–79%: C
- 60–69%: D
- < 60%: F

Plusses and minuses will be appended to letter grades at the instructor's discretion.

### 1/6 Attendance and participation

As we only meet once a week, missing even one class could leave you far
behind. Although much of the material will be posted online, class time will
be used to troubleshoot, debug, and debrief (read: "vent about how hard
programming is").

Obviously emergencies happen, and everyone is allowed one (1) unexcused
absence. Further unexcused absences will result in a deduction of half a
letter grade _from your final grade_.

Excused absences are easy to obtain: please just give me as much notice as possible. (I try to keep
track of religious holidays, but a heads-up is always appreciated.)

### 1/6 Reading quizzes

Starting in Week 2, we will have a reading quiz approximately every other
class. These quizzes are not meant to be punitive. Rather, think of them as
10 minutes or so to reflect, as cogently as you can, on specific aspects of
the reading.

At the end of the semester, I will drop the lowest one (for graduate students)
or two (for undergraduates) reading quiz scores when calculating your average
for the term.

### 1/3 Labs and midterm projects

We will start a lab in class approximately every other week; the lab will be
due at 11:59 p.m. following the next class.

Each lab will also ask you to write a short but detailed reflection on your
process and what you have learned. These short essays are meant to help you
as you decide on your midterm and final projects.

Think of the midterm project as the final project in miniature. This is a
chance for you to experiment with a methodology or take the next logical
steps with a lab. If it works, take the project even further for the final;
if it doesn't, the final project gives you a mulligan. **Null results are
valid here.**

### 1/3 Final project

The final project is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery over some
aspect of digital humanities that we have covered during the semester. Start
thinking early about what experiments you might want to run or what
tools/resources you might want to build for your final project, and feel free
to send me an email or come to office hours as soon as you have ideas.

## Statement on AI

(Adapted from ["Artificial Intelligence"](https://provost.tufts.edu/celt/online-resources/artificial-intelligence/ai-syllabus-statements/)
by the Tufts' Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching)

This course discourages the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)
for translation assignments. At the same time, the course also provides
opportunities to explore the use of GAI in supplementing or augmenting our
abilities to engage with and understand Homeric song.

To this end, we will adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **NEVER** submit AI-generated work as your own. To do so is considered a
   violation of Tufts' [Academic Integrity Policy]
   (https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-overview).
2. Familiarize yourself with the limitations of GAI tools. These tools all
   come with inherent biases, and they all make mistakes. Be aware that no
   matter how "confident" the AI seems, it does not actually "know" anything.
3. Cite all uses of AI. See suggestions from the [Chicago Manual of Style]
   (https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html)
   and the [MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/).
4. In addition to citation, please identify _how_ the GAI contributed to your work. (Your explanation need not be more than a sentence or two.)
5. If have any
   questions, please contact me by email, during office hours, or in class.

## Policies

### Attendance

Emergencies arise. Everyone is permitted one unexcused absence. If you will
need to miss additional classes, please let me know as soon as possible.

Each subsequent unexcused absence will result in a deduction of half a letter
grade from your final grade (i.e., an A will become an A-, an A- will become
a B+, etc.).

You are responsible for catching up on any work that you have missed, either
by coming to office hours or working with a classmate. As a rule, I will not
share lecture notes outside of what is already available on the course
website.

### Food and drink

Please eat only during breaks. (We'll have one about halfway through each
class.)

Otherwise, please stay hydrated.

### Sharing

This course is designed for everyone to feel comfortable participating in
discussion, asking questions, learning, and facilitating the learning of
others. In order for that atmosphere to be maintained, the recordings of our
conversations will only be shared with the enrolled students in the class
(not posted publicly) and it is prohibited for any of us who have access to
the video to share it outside the course. Similarly, I have specifically
designed the exams, handouts, and lectures for the people who are enrolled in
the course this term and those may not be shared outside this course. All of
this content is freely available on GitHub under a Creative Commons license —
attribution is all that is required.

## Resources

### Religious accommodations

Tufts University faculty, staff, and administration highly value and
acknowledge the religious diversity of its student body. Students seeking
religious accommodations related to their holy days are encouraged to
collaborate with faculty to make arrangements during the first week of each
semester. Consult the [Multifaith Calendar]
(https://chaplaincy.tufts.edu/multifaith-calendar/) for upcoming holidays,
links to the University Religious Accommodations Policy, and members of the
University Chaplaincy who are available to respond to questions on religious
observances.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified
students through the provision of reasonable accommodations. If you have a
disability that requires reasonable accommodations, contact the StAAR Center
at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or 617-627-4539. Please be aware that accommodations
cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for
their provision.

### Academic support at the StAAR Center

The StAAR Center offers a variety of FREE resources to all students. Students
may make an appointment to work on any writing-related project or assignment,
attend subject tutoring in a variety of disciplines, or meet with an academic
coach to hone skills like time management and navigating procrastination.
Students can make an appointment for any of these services by visiting
https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center.

### Student support, including mental health

As a student, there may be times when personal stressors or difficulties
interfere with your academic performance or well-being. The Dean of Student
Affairs Office offers support and care to undergraduates and graduate
students who are experiencing difficulties, and can also aid faculty in their
work with students. In addition, through Tufts’ Counseling and Mental Health
Service (CMHS) students can access mental health support 24/7, and they can
provide information on additional resources. CMHS also provides confidential
consultation, brief counseling, and urgent care at no cost for all Tufts
undergraduates as well as for graduate students who have paid the student
health fee. To make an appointment, call 617-627-3360. Please visit the CMHS
website: http://go.tufts.edu/Counseling to learn more about their services
and resources.
