# Lab 4: Classification and Validation (_Mapping Texts_ chs. 11 and 12)

As with [Lab 3](./03_core_deductive-inductive.md), your approach to
this lab will depend on the specific contours of your corpus.

Your assignment is to apply the techniques discussed in chapters
11 and 12 of _Mapping Texts_ to your corpus. You might begin
by calculating word embeddings for your corpus, and you might
subsequently validate your document similarities or topic
prevalences using pretrained embeddings. A third step could
involve fine-tuning a useful pretrained model on your corpus.

In some ways, you can think of this lab as a refinement of your
work in Lab 3 and as a substantial initial step towards your final
project.

The goal here is to experiment. You might not find anything useful
for this particular lab, but show your work and use the experiments
that you run here to focus your work for the final project.
