# Lab 3: "Be reasonable!" (_Mapping Texts_ chs. 9 and 10)

How you approach this lab will depend heavily on the kinds of
documents in your corpus. Broadly speaking, you will need to
answer two related questions about your data:

1. What classification scheme(s) might apply to your corpus? How might you label
   documents (or sub-documents) in a scalable way?
2. What features of documents in your corpus might you use to group documents
   by similarity?

Chapters 9 and 10 of _Mapping Texts_ contain a number of methods for classifying
and clustering the documents in your corpus â€” you do not need to make use of all
of them. But you should try to gain new insights into your corpus, preferably
insights that you could not gain merely be reading the texts.
