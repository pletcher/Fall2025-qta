# Lab 1: "From Text to Numbers" (_Mapping Texts_ ch. 6)

- Calculate the following for every text in your corpus:
  - Type-Token Ratio (TTR)
  - Vocabulary
  - Sparsity
  - Top 10 words per document
  - Top 10 words per corpus
  - (Do these calculations confirm Zipf's Law?)
  - (What about Herdan-Heaps' Law?)
- Calculate the relative frequency for the top 20 most-frequent terms
  in each document of your corpus.
- Calculate the TF-IDF for the top 20 most-frequent terms in each
  document of your corpus.
- Context: calculate term similarity for several key terms in your
  corpus — be sure to describe _why_ you view them as key terms.

Write a (3-5–page) lab report:

1.  State the problem (e.g., "When Taylor Swift sings, 'sorry,' what
    is she apologizing for?")
2.  Briefly discuss your hypothesis
3.  Describe your methods
4.  Analyze your results
5.  Briefly discuss conclusions, limitations of your approach, and
    potential future work
