# Lab 2: "Text Wrangling and Tagging" (_Mapping Texts_ chs. 7 and 8)

Using the corpora that you have assembled, create cleaned — erm, "tidy" —
versions of your documents. You will need to remove punctuation and stop
words, normalize your texts, and stem and/or lemmatize each token. (I.e., you will need to follow the workflow described in ch. 7.)

Then, analyze the tokens in your tidy texts: perform named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. What tools can you use for each of these tasks?

Finally, as always, write a brief lab report. (Use the general outline of how to write a lab report provided for Lab 1 above.)
